# Prueba Next + Google Maps API

## Installation

First, install the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

<br/>

**Note:** For the project to work correctly, you have to create a `.env.local` file in the root folder and add your Google Maps API key in it. Otherwise it won't load the map.

#### Example .env.local file
```NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=type_your_api_key_here```



## Getting started

1) Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```


2) Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
