# Prueba Maps

## Getting started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



> **Note:** For the project to work correctly, you have to create a `.env.local` file with your Google Maps API key in it. Otherwise it won't load the map.

### Example .env.local file
```NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here```
